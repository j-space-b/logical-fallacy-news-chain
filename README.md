# logical-fallacy-news-chain
Returns any logical fallacies in a news article and any related news articles for better perspective on the story.

### What is a logical fallacy, and why would it be in my news?
Logical fallacies are flawed reasoning or false arguments that can undermine the validity of a news source. Examples include circular reasoning, false
dichotomies, ad hominem attacks, etc - full list is below.  News Stories online are optimized to perform well on specific metrics like clicks or time spent, however optimizing for metrics alone does not guarantee the story was written with logically sound reasoning.

### How do I use this app for news?
Comparing news articles specifically for logical flaws requires reconciliation of reasoning about arguments rather than clicking on a headline, and will leave you with a greater awareness of the quality of your news.  Overall, allowing logical flaws to persist makes news stories less safe and ethical. 

### What effect would using this have?
Eliminating fallacies ensures news sources remain logically valid and aligned with human reasoning. This builds user trust and could lead to greater long-term retention.
